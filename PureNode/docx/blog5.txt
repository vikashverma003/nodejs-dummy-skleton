How Replication Works in MongoDB
MongoDB achieves replication by the use of replica set. A replica set is a group of mongod instances that host the same data set. In a replica, one node is primary node that receives all write operations. All other instances, such as secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they have the same data set. Replica set can have only one primary node.

Replica set is a group of two or more nodes (generally minimum 3 nodes are required).

In a replica set, one node is primary node and remaining nodes are secondary.

All data replicates from primary to secondary node.

At the time of automatic failover or maintenance, election establishes for primary and a new primary node is elected.

After the recovery of failed node, it again join the replica set and works as a secondary node.

A typical diagram of MongoDB replication is shown in which client application always interact with the primary node and the primary node then replicates the data to the secondary nodes.

Set Up a Replica Set
In this tutorial, we will convert standalone MongoDB instance to a replica set. To convert to replica set, following are the steps −

Shutdown already running MongoDB server.

Start the MongoDB server by specifying -- replSet option. Following is the basic syntax of --replSet −
